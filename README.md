docker-tree
============

There are several tools to see the relationship of the docker containers and images.  For example, [sen](https://github.com/TomasTomecek/sen) is a curses-based, or [dockviz](https://github.com/justone/dockviz) is a graphviz-based.

Different from those tools, this command line tool just displays the relationship and the network information.

It is not fancy like others, but is enough before you ask the docker inspect command.
