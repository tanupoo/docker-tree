docker-tree
============

For example, sen is a curses-based tool, or dockviz is a graphviz-based tool.

Different from those tools, this command line tool just dsplayes the tree information taken from the docker containers and images.

It is not fancy like others, but it is enough to understand the relationship and basic information of the network.
